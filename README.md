BlackboardUnzip
===============

python 3 unzip tool for blackboard / Toledo zipped submission entries


Usage
-----

This script unzips a collection of student submissions to a directory structure on your local machine with the names of the students. Also, if the submission is a zipped folder, this folder is extracted too.


BlackBoardunzip.py -i `inputfile` -o `outputdirectory`



Remarks
-----

This has only been tested with the KULeuven Blackboard implementation ("Toledo"). Minor tweaks might be necessary on other deployments because of differences in the 'metadata files'
